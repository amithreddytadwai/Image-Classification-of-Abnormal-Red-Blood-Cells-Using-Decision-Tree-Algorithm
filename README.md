# Image-Classification-of-Abnormal-Red-Blood-Cells-Using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm
The study aims to increase the number of abnormal red blood cells that can be detected 
using image processing. The shape of the red blood cells play an important role in determining
abnormal red blood cells .We give microscopic images of red blood cells as input. Images used 
in the system came from hospitalsâ€™ past patients. The image was then inserted into the program. 
The system processed and classified the image. 
This study used Decision-Tree Algorithm as a machine learning algorithm in 
classifying. The acquired image goes through an edge recognition using Canny edge detection. 
Gaussian filter was also used to remove the noise of the image that undergone Canny edge 
process . The contoured image goes through the process of classification analysis using 
DecisionTree Algorithm.As a result, the system detected and classified a total of ten abnormal 
red blood cells. In effect, the results show the name of the abnormal red blood cells detected in 
the image within the system including the soft copy of the list.
